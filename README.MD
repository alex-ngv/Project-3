##### NYC Data Visualization
#### By Alex, Sho & Yuriy

We created an app that allows users to visualize data about New York City.  A user is required to create an account to access the app's features.  The app allows a user to guess which borough they think ranks the highest in the data category they choose.  A donut chart rendering is then shown with the relevant data.
